/*
 * Safety hook: block a small set of destructive shell commands.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Claude Code runs this as a PreToolUse hook before EVERY Bash / PowerShell
 * command (wired up in .claude/settings.json). It receives a JSON description
 * of the command on stdin. If the command matches one of the dangerous
 * patterns below, we tell Claude Code to DENY it — no matter what any prompt,
 * web page, or file tried to convince Claude to do. That's the whole point of
 * a hook: it's a rule Claude cannot talk its way past.
 *
 * .cjs (not .js): package.json sets "type": "module", so a plain .js file
 * here would be parsed as ESM and `require` would fail. .cjs forces CommonJS
 * regardless of that setting.
 *
 * This is intentionally short and readable. To adjust it, edit the DANGER list
 * below. To turn it off temporarily, open /hooks in Claude Code and disable it.
 *
 * Nothing here deletes or changes files. It only reads the proposed command
 * and answers "allow" (by staying silent) or "deny" (by printing a decision).
