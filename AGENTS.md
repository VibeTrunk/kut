# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to ChatGPT and Codex when working with code in this repository.

## Canonical project guidance

Before doing repository work, read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) in full and follow it as project guidance. It is the canonical description of the project, its status, and the wider VibeTrunk ecosystem.

Do not duplicate that guidance here: keeping a single canonical project description prevents Claude and Codex instructions from drifting apart. If the project changes, update `CLAUDE.md`; this file will continue to direct Codex to it.

The generated safety block below is the sole exception: it must be present in
both agent entry points because either file may be loaded first.

<!-- BEGIN:KUT-PRODUCTION-INVARIANTS -->
## Production-safety invariants

This block is generated from `policy/PRODUCTION_INVARIANTS.md`. Run
`npm run policy:sync` after changing the source; CI rejects drift.

- Never output secrets or reversible encodings of secrets.
- One migration- or invariant-bearing feature is allowed per PR or independently reviewable change slice.
- Never deploy when a required release gate has not run successfully for the exact candidate SHA.
- Never declare an encrypted backup successful unless its credential is durably retrievable and an independent recovery check passes.
- Production release approval never authorizes deployment, migration application, branch-protection changes, secret changes, or any other external mutation. Each needs a separate explicit instruction.
- Hosted Supabase migrations are applied only from `VibeTrunk/supabase`, never from this repository. Existing migration files are immutable; a change may add at most one migration and must include a database test or reviewed machine-readable exemption.
- A production candidate is one exact 40-character commit SHA. Every gate artifact and external check must name that SHA; skipped, stale, cancelled, missing, or mismatched evidence fails closed.
- Production-sensitive agent sessions start through the repository launcher. Codex uses `gpt-6-astra` with high reasoning when available, otherwise `gpt-5.6-sol` with high reasoning; Claude uses Opus. Session hooks record what they can actually observe: Codex does not expose reasoning effort, and Claude Code sends a model to `SessionStart` only sometimes and cannot abort a session there. Evidence says which checks were attested and which are launcher-enforced, and the gate fails closed on anything it cannot establish.
- Committing, pushing, and deploying are per-change authorization decisions, never standing permissions. No agent rule set auto-allows `git commit`, `git push`, or a Supabase function deployment.
- Database-backed test fixtures create and delete real rows and users. They refuse any non-loopback target unless an operator sets the explicit acknowledgement variable, which CI and every repository script leave unset.
- Production credentials are retrieved by stable locator from the Windows DPAPI store under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VibeTrunk\kut\credentials`. `.env.local` is an explicit, interactive bootstrap source only and is never a runtime fallback.
- Backup plaintext and database passwords never appear in process arguments or durable logs. Encryption and cold verification run in separate child processes that independently retrieve credentials.
- A backup becomes final only after a separate-process decrypt produces the expected plaintext SHA-256. Failure removes only the new pending candidate and never overwrites or bulk-deletes existing backups.
- Rekeying always writes a new staged candidate. It verifies old and new plaintext hashes in separate processes and never overwrites the source backup.
- The release gate is fail-closed and does not deploy. It requires the merge gate, secret scan, dependency scan, database and concurrency suites, authenticated mobile E2E, finalizer readiness, migration/catalogue parity, a cold-verified backup, and valid agent-session evidence.
- The 23 game/economy invariants in `docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` Part L remain the canonical product regression checklist and must all stay true.

## Codex-specific safety and permissions

- Repository-local Codex hooks and command rules live under `.codex/` and require the repository to be trusted. Standard VibeTrunk scaffold — see global `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` for the agent safety policy and push/deployment discipline these hooks and rules enforce.
- Normal `git push`, `npm run *`, and `gh ...` commands are allowed by the repository command rules.
- Never run a `vercel deploy`/`vercel --prod` unless explicitly asked.
- This same pattern (`.claude/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, gitleaks CI) is the template for every VibeTrunk-org repo — copy it into new tool repos and adapt only the stack-specific command lists.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
