## Production-safety invariants

This block is generated from `policy/PRODUCTION_INVARIANTS.md`. Run
`npm run policy:sync` after changing the source; CI rejects drift.

- Never output secrets or reversible encodings of secrets.
- One migration- or invariant-bearing feature is allowed per PR or independently reviewable change slice.
- Never deploy when a required release gate has not run successfully for the exact candidate SHA.
- Never declare an encrypted backup successful unless its credential is durably retrievable and an independent recovery check passes.
- The owner's merge of a reviewed PR into main authorizes release and Vercel production deployment of that exact resulting SHA, conditional on the full production gate passing first. The agent runs the gate, records approval, asserts evidence and deploys without another confirmation. This does not authorize migration application, Supabase function deployment, branch-protection changes, secret changes or other external mutations.
- Hosted Supabase migrations are applied only from `VibeTrunk/supabase`, never from this repository. Existing migration files are immutable; a change may add at most one migration and must include a database test or reviewed machine-readable exemption.
- A production candidate is one exact 40-character commit SHA. Every gate artifact and external check must name that SHA; skipped, stale, cancelled, missing, or mismatched evidence fails closed.
- Production-sensitive work, including the release gate, runs in the owner's ordinary agent session. There is no production launcher or session receipt, and the gate does not certify which model ran it (ADR-108).
- Committing, pushing, and deploying are per-change authorization decisions, never standing permissions. No agent rule set auto-allows `git commit`, `git push`, or a Supabase function deployment.
- Database-backed test fixtures create and delete real rows and users. They refuse any non-loopback target unless an operator sets the explicit acknowledgement variable, which CI and every repository script leave unset.
- Production credentials are retrieved by stable locator from the Windows DPAPI store under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VibeTrunk\kut\credentials`. `.env.local` is an explicit, interactive bootstrap source only and is never a runtime fallback.
- Backup plaintext and database passwords never appear in process arguments or durable logs. Encryption and cold verification run in separate child processes that independently retrieve credentials.
- A backup becomes final only after a separate-process decrypt produces the expected plaintext SHA-256. Failure removes only the new pending candidate and never overwrites or bulk-deletes existing backups.
- Rekeying always writes a new staged candidate. It verifies old and new plaintext hashes in separate processes and never overwrites the source backup.
- The release gate is fail-closed and does not deploy. It requires the merge gate, secret scan, dependency scan, database and concurrency suites, authenticated mobile E2E, finalizer readiness, migration/catalogue parity, and a cold-verified backup.
- Every game/economy invariant in `docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` Part L remains part of the canonical product regression checklist and must stay true.
